				Hi, Iâ€™m Anna!

				I am passionate about all things psychology, health, and lifestyle. My curiosity about the inner workings of the mind led me to getting my Bachelors in psychology.

				Shortly after graduating from college, I developed an interest in web development so I decided to attend a coding bootcamp, where I gained the skills that would allow me to break into the tech field. I have professional experience in full stack development and I specialize in React and NodeJS.
